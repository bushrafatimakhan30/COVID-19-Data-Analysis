# EDA ON COVID19 DATASET
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of Asia and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and began referring to it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The WHO ended its PHEIC declaration on 5 May 2023, but as of 2 June 2023[6] continues to refer to it as a pandemic. Prior to this, some countries had already begun to regard COVID-19 as an endemic disease.
